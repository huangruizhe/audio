    "In part 1, we performed forced alignment at the utterance level. In practice, we don't usually have a small segment (e.g., 10 seconds) of audio and its corresponding exact, verbatim transcription as in a laboratory setting (e.g. [LIBRISPEECH](https://www.openslr.org/12) corpus). Instead, the audios come in long form (e.g., a whole mp3 recording of speech for an hour). The transcription for the whole recording can by noisy and non-verbatim, which may not exactly match what's been spoken in the recording. In particular, in order to use the raw speech data for machine learning, we usually need to prepare a corpus of segmented audios. In some applications, we still hope to align the long audio and text data as much as possible. In this tutorial, we will provide a python library to support such use cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we are facing two challenges:\n",
    "- The audio is long, which may not be suitable to be handled as a whole due to, e.g., limited CPU/GPU memory.\n",
    "- The transcript is noisy. It can be a partial transcript with some missing words. It may have significant errors. It may also contain extra contents that's not spoken in the audio (e.g., the corresponding audio is corrupted). It can be a combination of all cases. Thus, the conventional, basic forced alignment algorithm could provide very bad alignment results, as it assumes the audio and text match exactly.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few existing solutions:\n",
    "- [Kaldi](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8268956), [Gentle](https://github.com/lowerquality/gentle) and [this work](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7404861) employ a weighted finite state transducer (WFST) framework to model the noisy texts. \n",
    "- [WhisperX](https://github.com/m-bain/whisperX) uses attention mechanism to propose rough time stamps for uniformly segmented audio. Then, it performs phone-level or word-level forced alignment with an external aligner.\n",
    "- [MMS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13516) uses a special `<star>` token to handle missing words in the transcript.\n",
    "- [SailAlign](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/SailAlign%3A-Robust-long-speech-text-alignment-Katsamanis-Georgiou/0b7f86429641b188cc62ec32eee590e8795a3d02) iteratively identifies reliable regions and then narrows down to align the remaining unaligned regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial is based on WFST and thus falls in the first category. Our implementation is based on PyTorch. Any CTC model in PyTorch can be equipped with our library to become a robust aligner. This makes our aligner distinguish from existing ones."
